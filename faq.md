# FAQ
##### What is meaning of the name **naee**?
**naee** is “new” in Hindi
##### Why another BaaS?
We’re app developers, and during the last ten years we were struggling between several solutions, some good for a reason, some good for another reason, but at the end of day limiting our experience. The worst part was to use different services for the same app, like data with one, push and mail with others. We also partecipate in open source projects, but the development and fixing was was to slow for our needs. Then, one day, we decided to go on our own and, after a two years effort, we came out with **naee**; we truly believe it is how a BaaS has to be: easy to use and full packet.
##### Why it is not open source?
Instead of involving developers in backend software, our mission is to provide to them the best tools and services, in order to focus on client development. We love the open source community and we contribute in a lot of projects. With **naee** we want to curate as much is possible the developer’s experience, and we believe that the proprietary solution is the way to go.
##### Which client platforms are supported?
Currently the official SDKs available are:

- Swift SDK for iOS (9+), macOS (10.11+), tvOS (10+), watchOS (3+)
- Android SDK (API 21+)

Coming soon:

- JavaScript SDK
- Swift SDK for server platform (Vapor, Perfect, Kitura, etc.)
- Microsoft .net SDK

##### What about the lock-in danger?
We’re very committed in this project and we’re working really hard to grow it and make it become the most appealing BaaS solution in the market. 
If, for reasons that frankly we are not able to think of, we’ll decide to dismiss **naee**, it will be fully “opened” to the community and documented, even on the internals.
