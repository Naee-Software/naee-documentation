# naee Documentation

## Introduction

This is the documentation for **naee**, the new, easy to use and yet powerful cloud platform for app developers.

In this site youâ€™ll find a comprehensive walkthrough in all the components of the platform, from simple semantic meanings to examples and advanced topics.

**Note** that this is a preliminary version of the documentation. A lot of work is to be done and some content could not adhere exactly with the actual state of the SDKs.
